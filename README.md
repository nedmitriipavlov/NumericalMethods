## Solution of nonlinear equations
Nonlinear equations were solved using method of fixed point iteration (iteration_method.py), Newton's method (newton_method.py), secant method (secant_method.py). Simple functions have been given for coding. It is an easy job.

## Solution of equations systems
Solution nonlinear (nonlinear.py) and linear (gauss.py) equations systems using Newton's and Gauss method respictevely

## Interpolation
Making interpolation using Newton's interpolation (newton.py) and Spline interpolation (spline.py)

## Numerical integration
Integral calculation using trapezoid method, Simpson method and rectangle method (integration.py)

## Numerical differentation
Numerical deifferentation realized using devided difference (numericaldifferentation.py)

## Solution of the one-dimensional heat conduction equation by difference methods
Determine the temperature distribution along the length of a one-dimensional rod at different moments of time, depending on the initial and boundary conditions, and the material of the rod.
The length of rod - l. t - the duration of metal impact.

$k\dfrac{\partial^2 T}{\partial x^2} = \dfrac{\partial T}{\partial t}$

This task was solved for cuprum rod in my case (cuprum.py) using the implicit method.
