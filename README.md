# NumericalMethods
There are homewroks that were made in the course of Numeric Methods

## Solution of nonlinear equations
Nonlinear equations were solved using method of fixed point iteration (iteration_method.py), Newton's method (newton_method.py), secant method (secant_method.py). Simple functions have been given for coding. It is an easy job.
