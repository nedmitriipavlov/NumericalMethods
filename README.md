## Solution of nonlinear equations
Nonlinear equations were solved using method of fixed point iteration (iteration_method.py), Newton's method (newton_method.py), secant method (secant_method.py). Simple functions have been given for coding. It is an easy job.

## Solution of equations systems
Solution nonlinear (nonlinear.py) and linear (gauss.py) equations systems using Newton's and Gauss method respictevely

## Interpolation
